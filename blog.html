<h1>Blog</h1>

<p>Here comes our blog!</p>

<p>We also add this file on dev-01.</p>

<p>So, we add some more content on dev-01, but this time we will use a github pull request to merge into main.</p>

<p>02 It's time to add more blogs :)</p>
<p>Let's continue this blog post before we merge it to main again. I use "wip" commits for "work in progress".</p>

<h3>03 Squash successful</h3>
<p>
    So for changes on post 02 we used a squash merge on github, which combined all commits from dev-01
    into one commit on main. The main branch looks a lot cleaner like this, as the wip commits are
    not added as seperate commits to main!
</p>
<p>
    I don't quite understand yet, why vscode tells me, main branch is 5 commits ahead and 2 commits behind...?
